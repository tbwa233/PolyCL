["PolyCL: Context-Aware Contrastive Learning for Image Segmentation,"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10635698) by Aaron Moseley and Abdullah-Al-Zubaer Imran. In [IEEE ISBI](https://biomedicalimaging.org/2024/), 2024.

["Domain and Task-Focused Example Selection for Data-Efficient Contrastive Medical Image Segmentation,"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19208) by Tyler Ward, Aaron Moseley, and Abdullah-Al-Zubaer Imran. In [arXiv:2505.19208](https://arxiv.org), 2025.

Our proposed model employs innovative example selection strategies to pre-train models on unlabeled data, significantly improving segmentation performance and generalizability while reducing reliance on labeled dataâ€‹.
