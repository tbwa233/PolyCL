# PolyCL

This repository contains the implementation of PolyCL. Our publications for this project are listed below:

"PolyCL: Context-Aware Contrastive Learning for Image Segmentation," by Aaron Moseley and Abdullah-Al-Zubaer Imran. In IEEE ISBI, 2024.

"Domain and Task-Focused Example Selection for Contrastive Medical Segmentation," by Tyler Ward, Aaron Moseley, and Abdullah-Al-Zubaer Imran.

Our proposed model employs innovative example selection strategies to pre-train models on unlabeled data, significantly improving segmentation performance and generalizability while reducing reliance on labeled dataâ€‹.
